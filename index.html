    <p class="w3-pale-yellow">Some of us are anglers. Some of us are parents. All of us are human. And we're also passionate about the outdoors and
      conservation. Together, we work to bring you the best app for fishing, hands down. There's a lot of thought and effort
      and fun that goes into that. Some of us work from Hampton SC, USA. Some of us work from boats, casting lines and going
      to fishing tournaments. The office people and the boat people make sure to talk a lot. That's how we keep it real.
      We think fishing is better with buddies. We believe that it's more fun to brag about a catch with people who care about
      fishing. These people are often called anglers. You may think that's obvious, being an angler yourself. But on Fishbrain,
      your catch doesn't go head-to-head with cats doing backflips, or toddlers feeding chocolate cake to their baby sisters.
      For us, respecting the environment is about balance. We believe in catch and release and the sustainable harvest of
      fish species. Because when it comes to the outdoors, tomorrow matters too. Don't get us wrong - we're all for hard
      work, pre-dawn wakeups to get to a fishing spot, and getting our hands dirty. But if there's a smarter way to fish,
      we're on it. It means we do the hard work of crunching catch numbers so you don't have to. It means all you have to
      do is fish. Sometimes, simple is better. We know this one by heart, and that's the way it should be. At Fish Information,
      we're connecting anglers to make fishing dreams come true, today and tomorrow. "Fish Information" is all the information
      on the top 4 fish species in America. It proves pictures, writing information, as well as links to other sites for
      even more information. You can use this site for free and can have access to access even more information on the fish
      you see listed below from the "Learn More" tab. To help find fishing spot and directions to those spots, at the bottom
      of the page thier is a goggle maps page! Thanks for using Fish Information!

          <strong>Bass</strong>
        </h3>
        <p class="w3-opacity"> Freshwater Fish</p>
        <p class="w3-pale-green">Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides) are the most popular game fish in North America. Possessing a striking complexion
          while being one of the top predators in the natural ecosystem, the Largemouth Bass is an astonishing aquatic animal.
          Adult largemouth bass are solitary fish, although occasionally several bass will congregate in areas with abundant
          food supplies. They are usually the apex predator in their habitat. They will hide between rocks, among water vegetation,
          or under roots and limbs of sunken trees, striking at their prey from the shadows. Bass prefer quiet, calm, and
          warm water but are very adaptable to other conditions. They are found in rivers, lakes, ponds, reservoirs, and
          steams. Adult largemouth bass prefer to feed on small fish like perch, sunfish, and minnows. However, they are
          also known to eat crayfish, insects, frogs, and even small aquatic birds. A bass under two inches, known as a “fry,”
          will do not act as predators but instead feed on zooplankton and insect larvae. Adult largemouth bass prefer to

          <strong>Walleye</strong>
        </h3>
        <p class="w3-opacity">Freshwater Fish</p>
        <p class="w3-green">The interesting appearance, lovely taste, and distinctive habitat of the Walleye (Sander vitreus) makes it a very
          popular freshwater game fish in North America. American Expedition is proud to present information, interesting
          facts, and photos of the Walleye. The walleye is the biggest member of the perch family and is a very common freshwater
          game fish. On average, they measure 10 to 18 inches long and weigh 1 to 3 pounds, yet can grow to be well over
          this size. Walleye are olive and gold in color fading to a white underside. They have large dark spots on their
          back and smaller dark spots on their fins. This fish has a large mouth filled with many razor-sharp teeth. The
          walleye gets its name from a special pigment layer in its eye that reflects lights. This allows them to see more
          clearly in dark and murky water. Because of this, they are sensitive to light and will venture into deep waters
          on clear days. Spawning season occurs in the spring, mainly the month of April, when the water reaches around 40-55
          degrees Fahrenheit. The eggs (up to 500,000) are deposited by the female into shallow water. They hatch in about
          10 days and feed on plankton and insects. Neither the mother nor the father care for the babies. The lifespan of
          a walleye is about 10 years. Most states have the amount of a certain fish you can keep in one day.</p>

          <strong>Sturgeon</strong>
        </h3>
        <p class="w3-opacity">Freshwater Fish</p>
        <p class="w3-khaki">Lake Sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens, inhabit large river and lake systems primarily in the Mississippi River, Hudson
          Bay and Great Lakes basins. The Sturgeon is a darker brown fish. It has and continues to represent an important
          biological component of the Great Lakes fish community. By the early 1900's many populations of lake sturgeon throughout
          their range had been greatly reduced or extirpated as a result of overfishing, habitat loss, the construction of
          dams, and pollution. Lake sturgeon are listed as either threatened or endangered by 19 of the 20 states within
          its original range in the United States. This ancient family of fishes has been recognized since the Upper Cretaceous
          period (136 million years ago), at a time when dinosaurs were at the height of their development. Out of the 26
          species, over 20 are just commonly referred to as Sturgeon. The remaining few are distinctbut closely related species,
          examples including the Beluga and the Kaluga. The Sturgeon is one of the oldest species of bony fish in the world.
          Native to the temperate, sub-Arctic and subtropical areas Europe, Asia and North America; the Sturgeon is distinguished
          by an elongated body,absence of scales and occasional huge size. However, they still portray the distinct characteristics
          of the species, such as heterocercal tail fins.

          <strong>Catfish</strong>
        </h3>
        <p class="w3-opacity">Freshwater Fish</p>
        <p class="w3-blue-gray">Native to the Neartic, the Channel Catfish is one of the most popular game fish in North America. Due to their popularity,
          size, and good flavor when cooked, this catfish has been introduced to other places as well, such as Indonesia.
          The channel catfish is sometimes known as “Fork-Tailed Cat,” "Fiddler,” “Spotted Cat,” or “Lady Cat.” A catfish
          is easily distinguished from other species of fish because of their smooth, scaleless bodies. The channel catfish
          is olive to light blue in color with black speckles on the sides, has a forked tail, whisker-like organs around
          the mouth, a broad flat head, and a slender body. Males generally are darker in color and have larger heads than
          the females. The whiskers, known as “barbels,” are around their mouth with the purpose of helping them locate food
          in the dark waters. In addition, they have taste buds all over the surface of their body. Catfish grow continually;
          the larger the fish, the older it usually is. On average, channel catfish weigh between 2-7 pounds and measure
          12 to 24 inches long. However, many grow much larger than this, with the record weighing 58 pounds and measuring
          52 inches These “fries” stay in a school and eat small insects until they are older. Most catfish are mature by
          the time they are 12 inches long. A catfish’s average lifespan is about 15-20 years.
